# CypheXcomm FPGA

### üîê **CypheXcomm ‚Äì Secure Hardware Data Pipeline for Critical Communication**

A modular, scalable, and real-time FPGA-based platform for robust, hardware-level encryption and secure communication, tailored for industrial, IoT, and mission-critical systems.

---

## üß† System Architecture

CypheXcomm is built with a **layered and modular architecture**, where each block addresses a distinct function in the secure data pipeline. Data flows through all security and processing stages, each with strict separation and testability:

1. **Input Layer** ‚Äì Multi-protocol data capture (UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, ETH).
2. **Encoder** ‚Äì Frames, validates, and prepares data for processing.
3. **Scrambler** ‚Äì LFSR-based scrambling for obfuscation and physical-layer security.
4. **Encryption** ‚Äì Lightweight XOR encryption (upgradable to stronger block ciphers).
5. **FIFO & Bridge** ‚Äì Reliable buffering between asynchronous modules.
6. **Transmission** ‚Äì Handles valid flag, framing, and timing.
7. **Reception** ‚Äì Robust sync and validation of incoming frames.
8. **Decryption** ‚Äì Full pipeline reversal (decryption + descrambling).
9. **Decoding** ‚Äì Data integrity checks and reassembly.
10. **Output Layer** ‚Äì Custom UART TX, parity, frame abstraction, and LED/seven-segment debug output.

All modules are **pure VHDL**, testable as units and as a complete chain (see `/sim`).
**Debug signals** and validation hooks are included for deep tracing and validation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

* **Multi-layer Hardware Security:** Scrambling + Encryption + CRC at RTL.
* **Protocol Agnostic:** Modular input for UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO/Ethernet.
* **Extensive Debugging:** LED, Seven Segment, and UART debug signals for every stage.
* **Simulation Ready:** Layered testbenches for every block; end-to-end full-chain simulation.
* **Python Integration:** Python tools and scripts (in `/tester` or `/python`) for simulating and parsing UART data (useful for rapid testing and GUI demos).
* **Vivado IP Integrator Friendly:** Clean hierarchy for easy integration with custom IP blocks.
* **Submodule Support:** System can manage external or reusable VHDL/IP blocks as Git submodules.

   `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RazGoelman/CipherComm_FPGA.git`

2. **Open in Vivado (2021.1+):**
   Import as a project, or open the block design.

3. **Generate bitstream:**
   Use *Generate Bitstream* from Vivado GUI or TCL.

4. **Connect hardware:**

   * USB-UART for RX/TX.
   * (Optional) Onboard LEDs and Seven-Segment for debug.
   * BTN (BTNC) for demo triggers.

5. **Python Test/Demo:**
   Use scripts under `/tester` for GUI/CLI simulation and frame validation.

* **UART:** `UART_TXD`/`UART_RXD` routed to USB-RS232 (via XDC).
* **Clock:** Default `clk100mhz` pin; MMCM can generate system clocks.
* **FIFO:** Utilizes Xilinx FIFO Generator IP for async buffering.
* **BTN:** User button mapped for demo and data injection.
* **Submodules:**
  For contributing or extending, add reusable modules as Git submodules for versioned, decoupled logic.
